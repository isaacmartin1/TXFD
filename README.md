General notes:
  - All models value call options.
  - Use the input sections to change values.

Notes on the American Monte Carlo simulator:
  - Assumes no-arbitrage to get the "optimal value". However, since the risk free rate rate is below many dividend yields, the         model will tell you to exercise the option immediately. 
  
  - Make an excel spreadsheet of returns of your stock, and import that file to your sim.
